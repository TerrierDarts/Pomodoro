- Added Control to Short Break Counts before a long break. 
    * This control means you have X number of small breaks before a long break, so if it was set to 3 you would have 3 short breaks before having 1 long break.
- Control Progress Format with `%C` and `%T`
- Trigger Filter "Pomo Change" on a change.
